<h5 id="parallel-and-distributed-low-depth-algorithms-for-quantum-amplitude-estimation"><strong>Parallel and distributed low-depth algorithms for quantum amplitude estimation</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a core subroutine in quantum computation with various applications, including Monte Carlo integration. Quantum computers can potentially utilize QAE to achieve quadratic speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo. In the conventional approach, the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is used for amplitude estimation; however, QPE requires expensive controlled operations as well as a Fourier transform, which currently lead to difficulties with implementation in near-term quantum devices. In response to this, some alternative lower depth algorithms have been developed. In this project, I focused on implementing a parallelized and distributed version of the Power Law algorithm for QAE, which should further reduce the current hardware challenges by interconnecting small quantum computers as opposed to relying on a single big quantum computer.</p>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Quantum computing is usually associated with discrete quantum states and physical quantities possessing discrete eigenvalue spectrum. However, quantum computing in general is any computation accomplished by the exploitation of quantum properties of physical quantities, discrete or otherwise.

Currently, continuous variable quantum computing is a rapidly developing field both theoretically and experimentally. In this pedagogical introduction we present the basic theoretical concepts behind it and the tools for algorithm development.

<h5 id="brief-introduction-to-quantum-option-pricing"><strong>Brief Introduction to Quantum Option Pricing</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: This project is about quantum quantitative finance. We collected a substantial amount of relevant information on the topic and compiled a brief pedagogical introduction to Quantum Option Pricing. First, we will talk about the field of quantitative finance and introduce the financial instruments called options, along with the crucial Monte Carlo method for pricing American options - the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. We will then introduce the recently discovered quantum approach for pricing European Options. We conclude by outlining the direction for future research and development of the project after the conclusion of the QOSF Mentorship Program.</p>

<h5 id="quantum-image-encryption-algorithm"><strong>Quantum Image Encryption Algorithm</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: This project is about using quantum computers to scramble and encrypt images. A new quantum algorithm to encrypt a classical image, represented as a quantum state through FRQI encoding, was developed. The algorithm uses quantum baker scrambling, and quantum discrete cosine transform to perform encryption. The algorithm was simulated using Qiskit, and the performance of encrypted images was analyzed. The outcome will be a research paper, and it is also planned to make the code open-source, in the form of a github repository, along with the paper.</p>
