<h5 id="using-rnns-to-assist-variational-quantum-algorithms"><strong>Using RNNs to assist Variational Quantum Algorithms</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are powerful tools which promise to take full advantage of near term quantum computers. However, these algorithms suffer from optimization issues related to random initialization of the parameters. Using PennyLane and Tensorflow, I implemented the architecture proposed by Verdon et al. in ‚ÄúLearning to learn with quantum neural networks via classical neural networks‚Äù, which leverage a classical Recurrent Neural Network to assist the optimization of variational quantum algorithms by learning an efficient parameter initialization heuristics to ensure rapid training and convergence.</p>

<h5 id="solovay-kitaev-algorithm-and-fault-tolerance"><strong>Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm and Fault-Tolerance</strong></h5>

Nielsen</a> for the open source framework Qiskit. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem states that any single qubit gate can be approximated to arbitrary precision by a set of fixed single-qubit gates, if the set generates a dense subset in SU(2). This is an important result, since it means that any single-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of a discrete, universal gate set that we know how to implement fault-tolerantly. Therefore, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm allows us to take any non-fault tolerant circuit and rephrase it in a fault-tolerant manner.</p>

<h5 id="layerwise-learning-for-quantum-neural-networks"><strong>Layerwise Learning for Quantum Neural Networks</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: In this project we‚Äôve implemented a strategy presented by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14904.pdf">Skolik et al., 2020</a> for effectively quantum neural networks. In layerwise learning the strategy is to gradually increase the number of parameters by adding a few layers and training them while freezing the parameters of previous layers already trained. An easy way for understanding this technique is to think that we‚Äôre dividing the problem into smaller circuits to successfully avoid to fall into Barren Plateaus. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept for the implementation of this technique in Pennylane‚Äôs Pytorch interface.</p>

<h5 id="applying-the-variational-quantum-eigensolver-to-the-femo-cofactor-of-nitrogenase"><strong>Applying the Variational Quantum Eigensolver to the FeMo Cofactor of Nitrogenase</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Our project investigates the feasibility of using VQE on complex molecules by applying it to the FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase. Most of the experimental work on VQE has been for relatively small molecules, such as BeH2. We attempt to perform the same experiments on the ~200 electron FeMo cofactor, with the aim of identifying roadblocks one may encounter with larger molecules. The project is firstly a pedagogical exercise for ourselves, as we were both interested in immediate applications of NISQ computers for real-world quantum chemistry calculations. The secondary goal was to identify difficulties that may exist for VQE at larger scales, so that software stacks may be more equipped to handle these molecules as quantum devices mature.</p>

The computational complexity grows exponentially along with the systems‚Äô size when it comes to simulating quantum many-body systems on a classical computer.

An exact quantum simulation will allow us to access not only the ground state but also the full spectrum of many-body systems.

<p><em>Project description</em>: Machine Learning is a potential application for near-term intermediate scale quantum computers with possible speed-ups over their classical counterparts. Quantum classifiers are quantum circuits that can be trained to classify data in two stages; 1) Embedding: the input data is encoded into quantum states, embedding it to a high-dimensional Hilbert space. 2) Measurement: A quantum measurement of the circuit to discriminate between classes. Usually, the measurement part of the circuit is trained but in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03622">recent paper</a> an alternate approach has been adopted where the embedding part of the circuit is trained instead, freeing up more precious resources. In this work, we benchmark various embeddings and cost functions and propose improvements.</p>

<h5 id="the-schwinger-model-and-quantum-computing"><strong>The Schwinger Model and Quantum Computing</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Quantum field theories are the mathematical description of the physical world and underlie the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM). Quantum computers bear the possibility of contributing to progress in fundamental particle physics. With this project, the Lattice Schwinger model is chosen to explain the fundamental steps underlying QFT theories. The goal is to show, using the Schwinger model, how quantum field theories can be simulated on a quantum device with using descriptions and language suitable for those without a background in particle physics and quantum field theories.</p>
