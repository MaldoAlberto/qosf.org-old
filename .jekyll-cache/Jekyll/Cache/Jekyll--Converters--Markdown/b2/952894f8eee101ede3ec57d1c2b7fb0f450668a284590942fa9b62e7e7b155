<h5 id="qml-contribution-to-pennylane"><strong>QML Contribution to Pennylane</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: I see the interaction between machine learning and quantum computing as a very exciting field, so my project revolved around lowering the barrier for hybrid classical-quantum ML. My main contribution has been the addition of a “cost” module with a loss function to the Pennylane library, so that circuits with trainable parameters can be trained more easily. I am already working together with the Pennylane team to develop more utilities and ML-related features.</p>

<h5 id="applying-quantum-natural-gradient-to-accelerate-vqe"><strong>Applying Quantum Natural Gradient to Accelerate VQE</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Recently, several works have proposed and benchmarked quantum natural gradients which have the potential to accelerate the classical optimization loop in variational quantum algorithms. For our QOSF project, we contributed to the open-source quantum machine learning framework PennyLane to enable quantum natural gradients for VQE/VQE-like problems. We additionally provide notebooks that demonstrate VQE calculations of small molecules that leverage quantum natural gradients.</p>

<p><em>Project description</em>: This project is a deep dive into the question: what will quantum computers be useful for? We focus on the VQE algorithm on quantum mechanical solids, making simplifications until we arrive at a cornerstone of condensed matter physics: the Hubbard model.

<h5 id="implementing-a-swap-based-bidirectional-heuristic-search-algorithm-sabre"><strong>Implementing a SWAP-based BidiREctional Heuristic Search algorithm (SABRE)</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: Due to limited connections between physical qubits, most two-qubit gates cannot be directly implemented on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A dynamic remapping of logical to physical qubits is needed to enable execution of two qubit gates in a quantum algorithm on a NISQ device. In this project, we have implemented a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm (SABRE), proposed in the paper <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02573.pdf">Tackling the Qubit Mapping Problem for NISQ-Era Quantum Devices</a></em> by Gushu Li, Yufei Ding, and Yuan Xie that is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary qubit connections. Our goal with this implementation is to be able to provide a tool that can be used by quantum programmers to explore the qubit mapping problem on their own physical qubit connections or predefined chip architectures.</p>

<h5 id="quantum-algorithms-for-simulating-ground-state-of-quantum-many-body-systems"><strong>Quantum Algorithms for Simulating Ground State of Quantum Many Body Systems</strong></h5>

<p><em>Project description</em>: I studied how quantum algorithms can help in simulating the ground state  of quantum many body systems. Most of the algorithms currently at disposal (in the so-called NISQ era) to simulate the ground state of a given quantum Hamiltonian are based on variational approaches. While simple in principle, this class of methods require a good physical understanding of the system at hand, in order to make a reasonable (and reasonably simple) Ansatz for the target state.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the so-called imaginary time evolution algorithm ensures the convergence to the ground state, provided that the initial Ansatz had a non-vanishing overlap with the desired state. However, since based on the imaginary time evolution, this algorithm makes use of non-unitary operators, thus making it not particularly suitable to be implemented in a NISQ machine. It has been recently proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07653">Motto et al., 2019</a>.</p>
